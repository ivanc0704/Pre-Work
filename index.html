            <h2>About Me!</h2>
            <p> Hello! I'm a rising sophmore at Duke University planning on doing a Mechanical and Electrical engineering double major.
                I'm originally from Bluffton, South Carolina and attended the South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics for my junior and senior year of high school. 
                    I have various interests (arguably too many) that I'll list later on. 
                I love technology and learning and can't wait to try and apply my knowledge to create genuine change in the world!</p>
